# Plan and Milestones Overview

The **Plan and Milestones** module is the core of the World Plan and Milestone application, designed to help you organize projects and track progress effectively.

## Core Features

- **Plan Creation**: Build structured project plans with timelines and objectives.
- **Milestone Tracking**: Monitor key deliverables with customizable statuses (e.g., Not Started, In Progress, Completed).
- **Collaboration Tools**: Facilitate teamwork with real-time updates and role-based access.

## How It Works

- Plans serve as the foundation, containing milestones and tasks.
- Milestones are checkpoints within a plan, linked to due dates and assignees.
- Collaboration features ensure all team members stay aligned.
